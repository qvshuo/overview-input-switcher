# Overview Input Switcher

## Inspiration

This project is forked from [Hassleless Overview Search](https://github.com/mechtifs/hassleless-overview-search).

## Features

Switch to the default input source when entering the overview and restores it after exiting, resolving the conflict between the input method popup and the "Type to search" feature.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install it manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qvshuo/overview-input-switcher.git
cd overview-input-switcher
cp -r overview-input-switcher@anjing ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
```

Then log out of the GNOME session and log back in.
